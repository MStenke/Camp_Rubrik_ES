<p>Zaffre Fashion Group, especially their luxury Haverford brand, started the day in a not-so-great place. With the website down, Zaffre was losing money as the clock ticked. By leveraging the applications available to you as a Rubrik Enterprise edition customer, you were able to:</p>
<p>✅ Make your Data Resilient by safeguarding your data with secure backups so it can’t be deleted, compromised, or encrypted; and is always available for recovery.</p>
<p>✅ Make your Data Observable by identifying when, where, and how attacks have impacted systems by continuously scanning data over time so compromises can be remediated quickly.</p>
<p>✅ Perform Data Recovery by recovering data quickly with guided application-level recovery so business operations can be restored promptly.</p>
<p>We hope you've enjoyed this lab and learned how Rubrik’s solutions keep your data safe and easy to recover in the face of cyber-attacks and operational failures.</p>
