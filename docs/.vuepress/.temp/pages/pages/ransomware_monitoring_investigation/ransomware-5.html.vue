<p>Many ransomware recovery plans are based on restoring entire VMs. A ransomware attack doesn’t encrypt every file, so customers shouldn’t need to restore every file to recover. Normal day-to-day business functions routinely change data. These changes are coordinated across multiple files, databases, or even VMs.  If you restore files that weren’t affected by a ransomware attack, you may lose transactions or even get out of sync with other systems.</p>
<p>A far better approach would be to incorporate a multi-layered approach such as Rubrik’s instant file recovery into a recovery plan that can make it easy to recover only what you need.</p>
<p>Let's discuss how Zaffre can take advantage of this. The IT team can navigate to <strong>Haverford_Site &gt; haverford-webapp-01 &gt; var &gt; www &gt; html &gt; wp-content &gt; plugins</strong> folder as explained in the previous Ransomware Investigation lab section.</p>
<p>Select all the rows files on the page by selecting the box in the top row next to <strong>Name</strong>. After selecting the files, notice that the <strong>Recover</strong> button becomes available. Click on <strong>Recover</strong> and observe the various options available to recover the files.</p>

<p>For now, exit out of the recovery option. We will perform the recovery in a later section.</p>
