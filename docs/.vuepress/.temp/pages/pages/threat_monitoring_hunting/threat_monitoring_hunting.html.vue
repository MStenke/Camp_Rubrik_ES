I need a clean room!
<p>When an organization is hunting for a threat, the approach involves multiple threads, starting from:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Security Information &amp; Event Management (SIEM) platform to analyze the log data.</li>
<li>A Security Orchestration, Automation &amp; Response (SOAR) platform to pull together the threat data.</li>
<li>Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR) agents to pull information across the business</li>
<li>File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) to monitor for file tampering.
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS/IPS) scan for malicious activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>....There's a lot going on.</p>
<p>What if you could mine the backups of your environment, hunting for the indicators of compromise (IoC) that your adversary has left, like a breadcrumb trail? You could identify the <strong>where</strong>, <strong>when</strong>, and <strong>what</strong> easily. Even better, because you're hunting with the data held in Rubrik, your adversary has no idea that they are being hunted! This is exactly what Rubrik Threat Hunting enables.</p>
<p>You have become aware of a potential breach. The leadership team needs to know <strong>where</strong> and <strong>when</strong> the attacker might have gained a foothold. Once this is known, you Rubrik to roll back to a clean point in time.</p>
