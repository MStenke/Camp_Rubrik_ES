<p>To get started on the protection task, take a look at the inventory to ensure you know all the VMs that need to be backed up.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Inventory</strong> from the top ribbon and then <strong>vSphere Virtual Machines</strong>. You can see all the VMs that are protected and unprotected VMs. For now, you can focus on the unprotected VMs: haverford-dev, zaffre-dev, and zaffre-test.</p>

<h2 id="sla-domains" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sla-domains" aria-hidden="true">#</a> SLA Domains</h2>
<p>By default, there are three SLA domains with RSC: Bronze, silver, and Gold. To protect the VMs, create an SLA domain.</p>
<p>Click <strong>SLA Domains</strong> from the top ribbon and then <strong>CREATE SLA DOMAIN</strong>. Click <strong>CREATE</strong>, select <strong>vSphere VM</strong>, and click <strong>NEXT</strong>. Specify <strong>Every 6 hours</strong> as the frequency, and retain snapshots for 7 day. Keep everything else as default, specify Demo as the SLA Domain name, and click <strong>CREATE</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="sla-domain-assignment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sla-domain-assignment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> SLA Domain Assignment</h2>
<p>Now that you have created the SLA Domain, it's time to assign for you to assign it to the unprotected VMs and ensure it's protected.</p>
<p>To get started, head back to <strong>Inventory</strong> and <strong>vSphere Virtual Machines</strong>. Select haverford-dev, zaffre-dev, zaffre-test and click <strong>MANAGE PROTECTION</strong>. Select <strong>Demo</strong> SLA domain from the list, click <strong>NEXT</strong>, and lastly, click <strong>ASSIGN</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="@source/pages/welcome_to_zaffre/images/SLA-Domain-Assignment.gif" alt="SLA Domain Assignment"></p>
<p>Now you have completed the SLA Domain assignment.</p>
<h2 id="on-demand-backup" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#on-demand-backup" aria-hidden="true">#</a> On-demand backup</h2>
<p>As an administrator, you need to ensure that you schedule an on-demand backup.</p>
<p>Select haverford-dev VM from the inventory list. From the top right, click TAKE ON DEMAND SNAPSHOT and leave the rest of the details as defaults.</p>
<p><img src="@source/pages/welcome_to_zaffre/images/ondemandsnapshot.gif" alt="On-demand backup"></p>
<p>Repeat the steps for zaffre-dev and zaffre-test.</p>
