Normal day-to-day business functions routinely change data. These changes are coordinated across multiple files, databases, or even VMs. If you restore files that weren’t affected by a ransomware attack, you may lose transactions or even get out of sync with other systems.</p><p>A far better approach would be to incorporate a multi-layered approach such as Rubrik’s instant file recovery into a recovery plan that can make it easy to recover only what you need.</p><p>Let&#39;s discuss how Zaffre can take advantage of this.
