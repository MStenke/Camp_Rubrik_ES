# Conclusion

Zaffre Fashion Group, especially their luxury Haverford brand, started the day in a not-so-great place. With the website down, Zaffre was losing money as the clock ticked. By leveraging the applications available to you as a Rubrik Enterprise edition customer, you were able to:

:white_check_mark: Make your Data Resilient by safeguarding your data with secure backups so it can’t be deleted, compromised, or encrypted; and is always available for recovery.

:white_check_mark: Make your Data Observable by identifying when, where, and how attacks have impacted systems by continuously scanning data over time so compromises can be remediated quickly.

:white_check_mark: Perform Data Recovery by recovering data quickly with guided application-level recovery so business operations can be restored promptly.

We hope you've enjoyed this lab and learned how Rubrik’s solutions keep your data safe and easy to recover in the face of cyber-attacks and operational failures.
