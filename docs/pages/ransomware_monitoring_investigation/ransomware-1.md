# Accessing Ransomware Monitoring & Investigation

## Ransomware Monitoring & Investigation

As **Rubrik collects each backup snapshot’s metadata**, it leverages machine learning to build a perspective of what is going on with the workload. The model is trained to identify trends that exist across all samples and classify new data by their similarities without requiring human input. The result is that Ransomware Investigation detects anomalies, analyzes the threat, and helps accelerate recovery with a few clicks. 

Ransomware Monitoring & Investigation is available in the Rubrik Security Cloud as an application.
