# Accessing Sensitive Data Discovery & Management

## Sensitive Data Discovery & Management

As organizations adopt a hybrid model for their infrastructure, they grapple with massive data fragmentation, making it impossible to know where sensitive data resides. At the same time, the increasing risk of data privacy breaches and non-compliance with regulations can impose serious financial penalties. Sensitive Data Monitoring is an application in the Rubrik Security Cloud that discovers, classifies, and reports on sensitive data without any impact on production. By leveraging their existing Rubrik deployments, customers get up and running in just a few minutes with zero additional infrastructure required.

Sensitive Data Discovery & Management is available in the Rubrik Security Cloud as an application.
