As you can see, there are multiple predefined analyzers, and Rubrik keeps adding new ones quite frequently. 

::: tip Remember
Although Sensitive Data Discovery & Monitoring is a SaaS service that is managed in the cloud, the data scanning occurs on your CDM cluster, so no data ever leaves your control.
