# Tools you will be leveraging

## Rubrik Security Cloud
Rubrik Security Cloud operationalizes all the data situated in your distributed environment into a robust metadata framework. It organizes all the business information to make it discoverable and usable, no matter where it is. By consolidating all the metadata from several data sources into a unified system of record, Rubrik enables customers to enhance the business value hidden in their data assets.

## Rubrik Data Protection
Rubrik Data Protection (RDP) delivers centralized management for your global, distributed Rubrik environment. Designed for a seamless user experience, RDP provides a comprehensive view of customers' physical, virtual, and cloud topologies while making management tasks elegantly simple and intuitive. Search for a point-in-time activity by application or location. Determine SLA-compliant applications at a glance. Powered by an automated visualization engine, RDP enables filtering as you go to generate rich custom dashboards in minutes.

## Multi-Factor Authentication with Time-based One-Time Passwords
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enables Rubrik Two-step Verification for Rubrik clusters.

You can enable Rubrik MFA by using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) in your production or test environment, providing an additional authentication security layer. In addition to the username and password, TOTP uses an app to deliver a single-use numeric code as the second authentication factor.

## Role-Based Access Control
Rubrik provides end-to-end security for data by offering a multi-layered approach that protects the integrity and privacy of applications and data. Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts access based on the roles of individuals within an organization. Depending on the assigned role, access rights are restricted to the relevant associated information and resources.


## Declarative Policy Engine
Rubrik allows administrators to abstract away much of the low-end fuss required to build and maintain data protection to focus on adding value at a more strategic level across the organization. Rubrik's policy engine is simple as all of the imperative details are abstracted away and handled by an ingenious scale-out system. The customer input fields are reduced to RPO, retention period, archive target, and replication target for specifying SLAs for protected objects.
